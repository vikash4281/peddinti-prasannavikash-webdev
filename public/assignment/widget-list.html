        <p class="vsk-para">For many in India, R Ashwin is already an icon. The ICC Cricketer of the Year and Test Cricketer of the Year 2016 has steadily grown to a position where he is one of the best bowlers in the world. But success and particularly the kind of which Ashwin has achieved sometimes creates an unfathomable disconnect.

            In this interview, which explores themes such as self-belief, confidence (or the lack of it) and more, Ashwin talks passionately, revealing struggles in his formative years and shows empathy towards fellow cricketers.

            Through it, Ashwin narrates the tribulations he faced while studying and how it forged him to become the person he is, and indirectly inculcate a sense of self-belief. Ashwin also elucidates the kind of relationship he shares with Virat Kohli, on what it was like before and after he dons the India jersey and a lot more. His story is one that is instantly inspiring, yet relatable in many ways.

        <p class="vsk-para">An idea born in unsettled times becomes a feat of engineering excellence. The most complex machine ever built to bring humans to and from space and eventually construct the next stop on the road to space exploration.
            In that time, more than 200 people and a variety of international and commercial spacecraft have visited the orbiting laboratory. The space station remains the springboard to NASA's next great leap in exploration,
            including future missions to an asteroid and Mars.</p>
